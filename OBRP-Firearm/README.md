# Firearm test for QB-Core
Firearm test for qbcore FiveM servers. Credit goes to creator of qb-dmv which this firearms test is a edited version.


This is a script based on [Bamablood94's DMV script](https://github.com/bamablood94/qb-dmv)  which is free to use. The idea behind this script is that is gives the default "weapon" license in a more roleplay friendly way to the player who talks to the cop ped and passes the theory test.
