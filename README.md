# Firearm test for QB-Core
Firearm test for qbcore FiveM servers. Credit goes to creator of qb-dmv which this firearms test is a edited version of that script.


This is a script based on [Bamablood94's DMV script](https://github.com/bamablood94/qb-dmv)  which is free to use. The idea behind this edited version of the script is that is gives the default "weapon" license instead of a drivers license and in a more roleplay friendly way to the player who talks to the cop ped and passes the theory test.

# Installation

Drag and drop into your resource folder

Ensure the resource


# Editing

You can edit the server logo (dmv.png) with your own and also the wording of the opening screen/text in the ```ui.html```


If you would like different questions/answers you can edit the ```question.js ``` to your liking

You can add your custom item for a weapon license by editing "weaponlicense" in the ```server.lua``` on line 20 & 21

You can change the location and type of ped that spawns to whatever/wherever you would like, by default it is a cop behind the front desk on the left inside this [Mission Row PD station](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/community-mission-row-pd) MLO, if you do not use this one I would suggest moving him elsewhere.
