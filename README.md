# Firearm test for QB-Core
Firearm test for qbcore FiveM servers. Credit goes to creator of qb-dmv which this firearms test is a edited version of that script.


This is a script based on [Bamablood94's DMV script](https://github.com/bamablood94/qb-dmv)  which is free to use. The idea behind this edited version of the script is that is gives the default "weapon" license instead of a drivers license and in a more roleplay friendly way to the player who talks to the cop ped and passes the theory test.

You can edit the server logo (dmv.png) with your own and also the wording of the opening screen/text in the ```ui.html```


If you would like different questions/answers you can edit the ```question.js ``` to your liking

You can add your custom item for a weapon license by editing "weaponlicense" in the ```server.lua``` on line 20 & 21

You can change the location and type of ped that spawns to whatever/wherever you would like, by default it is a cop behind the front desk on the left inside this [Mission Row PD station](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/community-mission-row-pd) MLO, if you do not use this one I would suggest moving him elsewhere.
